          <minit class="blue">Peking duck</minit>
          Peking duck is a dish from Beijing (Peking)[1] that has been prepared since the imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is often eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used.

          <minit class="red">Xiaolongbao</minit>
          Xiaolongbao (/ˈʃaʊlɒŋˌbaʊ/) is a type of Chinese steamed bun (baozi) from Jiangsu province, especially associated with Wuxi and Shanghai (Shanghai was formerly a part of Jiangsu province). In Shanghainese, they are known as siaulon moedeu or xiaolong-style mantous[1] as Wu Chinese-speaking peoples use the traditional definition of "mantou", which refers to both filled and unfilled buns. It is traditionally prepared in xiaolong, which is a kind of small bamboo steaming basket,[2] which give them their name. Xiaolongbao is often referred to as a kind of "dumpling", but should not be confused with British or American-style dumplings, nor with Chinese jiaozi.
